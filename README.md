# CS32-Battleship
C++ Terminal Battleship Game Implementation

## Summary
This is a simple battleship game that incorporated a wide range of C++ data structures and algorithms to construct three different levels of CPU difficulty. The easiest uses simple random choice. The medium uses recursion to randomly choose the best square after hitting a ship. The hardest bot always shoots optimally when hitting a ship and shooting throughout the board.

## Running the Program
To run this program use the following C++11 compiler

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeyj11/CS32-Battleship
cd CS32-Battleship
g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o run.out
./run.out
```

This program runs on C++11, so make sure to compile accordingly if you use a different command set.

## Technologies
```
∙ C++
∙ Hashtables, Classes, Vectors, Structs
∙ Recursion / Dynamic Programming
∙ Inheritance & Abstraction
```

## Role
This was an assignment at UCLA in my data structures / algorithms class, and thus the project was completely up to me to implement.
